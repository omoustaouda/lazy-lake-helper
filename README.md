# Lazy Lake Community Helper

A Telegram bot that helps households and communities to coordinate around recurrent tasks and reminders.

### Note:
I'm doing this little project to refresh my Python skills (it has been years since I didn't create something with python!).
I'm building it using LLMs (ollama, and gpt). The aim is not at perfection, but more as something functioning, that could help me in my journey of refreshing Python.

## Features

- House chores reminders
- Pickup task reminders (e.g., Solawi)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your actual values
4. Run the bot: `python src/bot.py`
